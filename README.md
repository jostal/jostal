# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Joseph Talon. I am currently an Engineering Systems & Computing student at the University of Guelph and I love to work on applications using web technologies. Here you can see in detail the side projects I have worked on

### Cratis

[Cratis](https://github.com/cratis-app/cratis) is a bi-directional outliner built using Tauri and SvelteKit. You can create notes using markdown, link to other notes, and view all your notes and their connections in a network graph.

Cratis also uses SQLite as a local database for holding information on your network of notes.

### Dashboard

[Dashboard](https://github.com/jostal/dashboard) is a customizable homepage for your browser. You can add shortcuts with custom icons, rearrange the shortcuts, select your search engine, change the background, and more.

Dashboard was developed using SvelteKit and Supabase/PostgreSQL.
